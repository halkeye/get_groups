## Purpose

Google doesn't provide a simple way for end users to see whose in groups and such. 
This Simple little script will output an html page with all the groups and the members

## Usage

`node index.js`

This will create `public/index.html` and output the group data to stdout.

First time you run it, it'll ask you to goto a url, and enter the code it returns.
